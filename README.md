# Extend your KNX System with Arduino and Raspberry managed devices

The RoomController will allow you to integrate custom Arduino devices, such as analogue switches, weather sensors, etc. into your KNX system.
Using CentralLink you will be able to integrate your HomeServer (e.g. running on Raspberry) and radio transmissions into your KNX system. 
RoomController and CentralLink will be able to communicate bidirectional with your KNX system. You can send or receive telegrams and will be able to add custom actions.
